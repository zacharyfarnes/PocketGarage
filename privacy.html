            <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>At Pocket Garage, your privacy is a top priority. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle your data and ensure your information is protected in accordance with Apple's App Store guidelines.</p>

            <h3>Data Collection</h3>
            <p>Pocket Garage does not collect or store any personal data on its own servers. The app is designed to function using Apple’s iCloud, which securely stores your data within your own iCloud account. No information is sent to or stored on external servers, with the exception of your vehicle registration number for quick entry purposes, which is sent securely to the DVLA API to fetch your vehicle details.</p>

            <h3>What Data is Stored?</h3>
            <p>The following types of information related to your vehicles may be stored in iCloud when using Pocket Garage:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Vehicle information (registration number, tax and MOT due dates)</li>
                <li>Vehicle-related expenses (fuel, maintenance, repairs)</li>
                <li>Reminders for upcoming events (MOT, tax, etc.)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>DVLA API Usage</h3>
            <p>When you choose to use the "Automatically Add" feature, the app sends your vehicle registration number to the UK Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) via their API. The DVLA API will return basic details about your vehicle (such as make, model, and year), which will then be automatically populated within the app for your convenience. The registration number is sent securely and only for the purpose of retrieving vehicle details. No other personal information is sent to the DVLA, and the vehicle details are not stored outside of your device or iCloud account.</p>

            <h3>iCloud Data Storage</h3>
            <p>All data stored by Pocket Garage is saved directly to your personal iCloud account. Apple provides a secure environment for the storage of this data, and it is linked only to your Apple ID. You can manage and delete this data at any time via your iCloud settings.</p>

            <h3>No Third-Party Sharing</h3>
            <p>Pocket Garage does not share any user data with third-party services, companies, or advertisers. Your data remains private and secure within your iCloud account, and only your registration number is transmitted to the DVLA API for the purpose described above.</p>

            <h3>Data Security</h3>
            <p>As Pocket Garage uses iCloud to store data, your data is secured by Apple’s data encryption protocols. We do not access or store your iCloud credentials. Any communication with the DVLA API is also conducted securely, ensuring your vehicle registration information is protected during the process.</p>

            <h3>Your Rights</h3>
            <p>As a user of Pocket Garage, you have full control over your data. You can choose to delete the app and its associated data from iCloud at any time through your iOS device settings.</p>

            <h3>Changes to the Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in technology, applicable law, or our app features. Any updates will be posted on this page.</p>

            <h3>Contact Information</h3>
